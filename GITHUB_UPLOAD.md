# Upload Code to GitHub - Easy Method

## Method 1: Use GitHub Web Interface (Easiest!)

2. **Click "uploading an existing file"** (or the upload button)
3. **Drag and drop your entire project folder** OR click "choose your files"
4. **Navigate to:** `/Users/danielmoore/right-hand-labs`
5. **Select all files** (Cmd+A) and upload
6. **Commit** with message: "Initial commit"
7. **Click "Commit changes"**

## Method 2: Use GitHub Desktop App

1. Download: https://desktop.github.com
2. Sign in with GitHub
3. File → Add Local Repository
4. Choose: `/Users/danielmoore/right-hand-labs`
5. Click "Publish repository"
6. Done!

## Method 3: Personal Access Token (If you want to use command line)

The tokens page is at: https://github.com/settings/tokens/new
- Or go to: GitHub → Your Profile (top right) → Settings → Developer settings → Personal access tokens → Tokens (classic)

**Recommended: Use Method 1 (Web Upload) - No tokens needed!**
